Hi! Welcome to my first ever full project. So, full disclosure, even though this whole project was made from scratch (not Scratch, scratch) I did used AI to help me sort out some stuff.
Regardless, I learned a lot during this project. So, few things about the project itself first:

Tools used: PyQt6, os, JSON, datetime

How it works: the user opens up the main window and has options of "add" that allows you to add notes. "list" allows you to store the notes and access them as necessary. "reminders" allows you 
to view the list of reminders that is due.

initially, when you open up the "add" you are able to add in your notes as a sticky note. have them float around in your desktop and access as necessary. at any point you want to save it as a 
reminder you can choose "set reminder" and the app works to give you a pop up when it's time to remind you about the note. Now, to be sure. this is not a alarm clock. simply a nudge to you to 
make you aware of that specific note that you have saved. but that's about it, instead of having multiple sticky notes around your monitor and you losing your mind on what to keep track of, allow
the app to keep track of the notes and notify you when you need it to be remembered. 

Future plans:
Since this app is in beta phase, there's more Quality of Life features I want to add to this that would make this app more useful. imagine the app becomes a sort of your daily crutch when you struggle
to handle many things at once and you need some help to keep yourself organized. 
Hoping to add theme to the app. maybe a phone notificaion at one point so that you can always be aware of the reminders whenever you need it. Allowing it to be your assistant that holds all the information
that you need without overwhelming you with alarms

I look forward to polishing it much much more as i continue my studies and polish it along the way. 

Thank you!
